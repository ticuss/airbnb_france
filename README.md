Hello, I'm learning Data analysis using R. I'm using 2 datasets: the airbnb listings details and all the reviews of those bnb.

The dashboard is showing some keys numbers of the market like the total number, the average price... following with a interactive map (zoom in/out and look at each bnb's summary). The last part is to extract the most used keywords in the reviews and a simple sentiment analysis of the reviews.
